# Score
Score-keeping iPhone app that can be used to keep score in Scrabble, poker, card games, or games that keep a numerical scorecard.

## App Features
Simple interface makes it easy to add players, add and subtract from their score, and reorder 
players by increasing and decreasing order of their scores. A save feature allows users to exit the game and reload it once the app is closed using core data. Sharing scores through messenger and starting a new game is as easy as a simple click.
